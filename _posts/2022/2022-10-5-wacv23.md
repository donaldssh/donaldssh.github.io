Our work **"Learning Across Domains and Devices: Style-Driven Source-Free Domain Adaptation in Clustered Federated Learning"**, done in collaboration with [VANDAL](http://vandal.polito.it/){:target="_blank"} research group of Politecnico di Torino, has been accepted at [WACV 2023](https://wacv2023.thecvf.com/){:target="_blank"}, held in Hawaii.

TL;DR: We propose the novel task of Federated source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA) in which the clients' data is unlabeled and the server accesses a source labeled dataset for pre-training only. To solve FFREEDA we propose LADD which leverages the knowledge of the pre-trained model by employing self-supervision with ad-hoc regularization techniques for local training and introducing a novel federated clustered aggregation scheme based on the clients' style.
