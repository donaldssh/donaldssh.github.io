I am a first year Ph.D. student in [Information Engineering](https://phd.dei.unipd.it){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it){:target="_blank"}.

I received the Master's Degree in ICT for Internet and Multimedia at University of Padova in September 2021, and before that, the Bachelor's Degree in Electronics Engineering for Energy and Information at University of Bologna in October 2019, both with honors.
