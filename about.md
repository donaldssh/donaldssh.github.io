I am a first year Ph.D student at [Department of Information Engineering](https://www.dei.unipd.it/){:target="_blank"} of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it){:target="_blank"}.

I received the Bachelor's Degree in Electronics Engineering for Energy and Information at University of Bologna in October 2019, and the Master's Degree in ICT for Internet and Multimedia at University of Padova in September 2021, both with honors.

My main research interests are in Deep Learning and Computer Vision, in particular:
* Incremental and Coarse-to-Fine Learning
* Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
* Semantic Segmentation
